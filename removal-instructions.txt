STEP 5: Monitor Removal Status

   - "Temporarily removed" = Successfully removed (lasts ~6 months)

================================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES:
================================================================================

⏰ TIMELINE:
- Removal requests are processed within 24-48 hours
- Temporary removals last approximately 6 months
- Permanent removal happens when Google recrawls and confirms 301 redirect

⚠️  REMOVAL vs REDIRECT:
- Removal request = Immediately hides URL from search results (temporary)
- 301 redirect = Permanently tells Google content moved (long-term solution)
- Both are needed: Removal for quick fix, redirect for permanent solution

✅ WHAT HAPPENS AFTER REMOVAL:
1. URL disappears from Google search results within 24-48 hours
2. Google will recrawl and discover the 301 redirect
3. After ~6 months, temporary removal expires but 301 keeps it away
4. Page authority transfers from old URL to /about page
5. Users clicking old links automatically go to /about page

📊 MONITORING:
- Check "Removals" section weekly for first month
- Monitor "Coverage" report to see URLs marked as "Redirect"
- Check Google Analytics for any 404 errors (should be zero for these URLs)
- Review "Performance" report to ensure old URLs don't appear in search queries

🔄 IF REMOVAL FAILS:
1. Verify the exact URL format (with https:// and www if applicable)
2. Check that 301 redirect is working on your live site
3. Wait 24 hours and try again
4. Contact Google Search Console support if issues persist
